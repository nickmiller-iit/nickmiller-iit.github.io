The lab works on a variety of questions related to the population genetics and evolution of herbivorous insects, especially crop pests. Major areas of interest include:

* Adaptation of pest insects to genetically modified crops.
* Determining migration routes.
* Population structure associated with host plants.
* The basis of generalist *versus* specialist feeding habits.
